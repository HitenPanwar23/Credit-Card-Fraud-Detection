# Problem Statement

Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

Online cyber fraud is a major problem today in financial world. Credit card fraud detection, which is a data mining problem, becomes challenging due to two major reasons - first, the profiles of normal and fraudulent behaviours change constantly and secondly, credit card fraud data sets are highly skewed.The performance of fraud detection in credit card transactions is greatly affected by the sampling approach on dataset, selection of variables and detection technique(s) used.<br/> 
This project checks the performance of Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest Classifier on highly skewed credit card fraud dataset. The dataset is sourced from kaggle. The three methods are applied on the raw and preprocessed data. The work is implemented in Python. The dataset is spliited into train data and testvdata in the ratio 80:20 i.e. 80% train data and 20% test data.

# Conclusion

The performance of the models are evaluated. Confusion matrix is shown and test data accuracy is calculated. The results shows of optimal accuracy for naïve bayes, k-nearest neighbor and random forest classifier are 94.96%, 99.7% and 99.9% respectively. The comparative results show that Random Forest Classifier performs better than naïve bayes and logistic regression techniques.
